# NNFS
Learning Neural Network using Sentdex video

Framework.py - The OOP implementation of all the p* in conjunction together

p1.py - Understanding the basics of Neuron Code

p2.py - Learning about key concepts suh as weights, biases and how they affect the outcome. Also, trivial implementation of the dot product

p3.py - Transition to using libraries such as np and more industry standard data types such as matrices and vectors

p4.py - Batches, Layers and Objects, scaling the implementation to work in batches which is an array of inputs 

p5.py - Rectified Linear activation, piecewise function in order to focus on non-negative values

p6.py - Softmax activation, Which is the exponentiation and normalisation of the data

p7.py - Calculating loss via Categorical cross entropy, this is a method of calculating the amount of loss needeed for a score with a varying confidence level. Less confident we are, the more loss required.
